# Database_Management_System
**Course Objectives:**

1) **Understand DBMS and ER Modeling:** Learn the fundamental concepts of Database Management Systems (DBMS) and Entity-Relationship (ER) modeling, which are crucial for designing databases and representing data relationships.

2) **Explain Normalization, Query Optimization, and Relational Algebra:** Gain the ability to explain key concepts such as normalization (improving database efficiency), query optimization (enhancing database performance), and relational algebra (the foundation of database queries).

3) **Apply Concurrency Control, Recovery, Security, and Indexing:** Develop practical skills in managing databases by applying techniques for concurrency control (handling multiple transactions), recovery (restoring databases after failures), security (protecting data), and indexing (improving data retrieval in real-time scenarios).
